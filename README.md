# MITM-Detection-Mechanism-at-client-side-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Man-in-the-Middle attacks are talked about a lot in the technical field of computer security because they are one of the biggest concerns for professionals. The client system is not equipped to detect, prevent, and control these attacks, making it vulnerable to attack for the attacker. Our goal is to build a quality Intrusion Detection system using Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning that will detect network attacks on a client side basis in order to prevent those attacks from happening.
